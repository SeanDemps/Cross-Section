This was a sound art project I completed at University of Limerick with my classmate Mark O'Brien.

Mark and I collected sounds around Limerick city and presented the sounds in a neutral way, with minimal sound editing.
The site shows the user 4 randomly selected tiles, with a vague map location of where the sound was recorded.
